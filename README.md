# churn-prediction-ml
This project has been engineered as an end-to-end full-scale Machine Learning solution for churn prediction analysis, to mirror real-world data science workflows. It includes robust data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling), advanced feature engineering, and class imbalance treatment using SMOTE. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed with Seaborn and Matplotlib, uncovering insights through heatmaps, boxplots, and customer segmentation visuals. Multiple classification models are built and evaluated using Scikit-learn, optimized with precision and recall. The final model is serialized with Pickle, preparing it for deployment. This project emphasizes clean, modular code, reproducibility, and business impact, showcasing a blend of technical rigor and storytelling. It highlights key strengths: end-to-end ML pipeline development, real-world problem solving, data visualization, model explainability, and the ability to translate data into strategic insights.
